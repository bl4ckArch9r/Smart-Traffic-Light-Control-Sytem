# 🚦 Smart Traffic Light Controller 

### Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT)  
📘 **Course:** IE2082 – Discrete Mathematics  
📅 **Completed:** October 2025  

---

## 🧠 About the Project  
Designed and developed an **AI-inspired Smart Traffic Light Controller** that dynamically optimizes signal timings at a busy intersection using **GNU Octave**.  
This intelligent system adapts to **real-time traffic density**, prioritizes **emergency vehicles**, and models **congestion patterns** — combining **programming, mathematical logic, and data visualization** into a single adaptive solution.

## ✨ Key Highlights  

🕹️ Simulated **24-hour real-world traffic flow** for a 4-direction, 6-lane intersection.  
💡 Integrated **adaptive signal logic** using conditional statements and switch-case control.  
🚨 Built an **emergency mode system** that prioritizes ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles.  
📊 Created **visual dashboards** (line charts & histograms) for traffic density and distribution.  
🧮 Applied **quadratic modeling** to analyze traffic delay and congestion levels.  
⚡ Utilized **vectorized matrix operations** for faster and more efficient computation.
